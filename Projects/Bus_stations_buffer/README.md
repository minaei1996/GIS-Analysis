Assessment of the Coverage Areas for Tehran's Urban Bus Stations

In this project, the areas covered by Tehran's urban bus stations were assessed by adding a 500-meter buffer radius to the stations. The areas lacking accessibility are also clearly identified.
The utilized layers were procured from free access sources, and the output file for this project is also available at no cost.
The final output is presented in a PDF file.
